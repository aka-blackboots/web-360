# web-360

### Introduction

With everything coming to web and eventually to spatial computing, there is 
a need to render 360 images more intuitively on web and XR devices.

This library will try to serve a purpose to render 360 content directly in 
web without any prior knowledge of 3D

The immediate goal is to render 360 images and the end goal is to have a
Open Source competitor to 360 content streaming services.
